// Your function takes two arguments:

// current father's age (years)
// current age of his son (years)
// Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old).



//create function
//get fathers age 
//get sons age 
//find common denominator 


//solution 1
function twiceAsOld(dadYearsOld, sonYearsOld) {
    return Math.abs(dadYearsOld - 2 * sonYearsOld);
  }

// Can you help her?
